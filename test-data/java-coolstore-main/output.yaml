        message: |-
          Session replication ensures that client sessions are not disrupted by node failure. Each node in the cluster shares information about ongoing sessions and can take over sessions if another node disappears. In a cloud environment, however, data in the memory of a running container can be wiped out by a restart.

           Recommendations

           * Review the session replication usage and ensure that it is configured properly.
           * Disable HTTP session clustering and accept its implications.
           * Re-architect the application so that sessions are stored in a cache backing service or a remote data grid.

           A remote data grid has the following benefits:

           * The application is more scaleable and elastic.
           * The application can survive EAP node failures because a JVM failure does not cause session data loss.
           * Session data can be shared by multiple applications.

        message: ""
        codeSnip: "105  \n106  A local development server can be quickly fired up by using the Gruntjs server task:\n107  \n108      grunt server\n109  \n110  This local static asset server (i.e., [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)) has the advantage of having livereload integration. Thus, if you start the Gruntjs server, any changes you make to `.html` or `.less` files will be automatically reloaded into your browser and the changes reflected almost immediately. This has the obvious benefit of not having to refresh your browser and still be able to see the changes as you add or remove them from your development files.  Additionally, any changes made to Jekyll source files (`tests\\pages/`) will trigger a Jekyll build.\n111  \n112  ### Coding Style\n113  \n114  See [http://codeguide.patternfly.org/](http://codeguide.patternfly.org/).\n115  \n116  ## Build\n117  \n118  ### CSS\n119  \n120  In development, styling is written and managed through multiple lesscss files. In order to generate a CSS file of all styling, run the build Gruntjs task:\n121  \n122      grunt build\n123  \n124  This task will compile and minify the lesscss files into CSS files located at `dist/css/patternfly.min.css` and `dist/css/patternfly-additional.min.css`.\n125  \n126  ### PatternFlyIcons Font\n127  \n128  PatternFlyIcons font is generated using [IcoMoon](http://icomoon.io/app). Go to [manage projects](https://icomoon.io/app/#/projects) and import the project `PatternFlyIcons-webfont.json`. Load it and update as necessary. When finished, return to manage projects, and download the updated `PatternFlyIcons-webfont.json` file. Also generate the fonts. Please commit the updated `PatternFlyIcons-webfont.json` file, the updated font files and supporting LESS/CSS changes.\n129  For detailed instructions, please see our [PatternFly Icon Guide](PFICONS.md)\n130  \n131  ## Tests\n132  \n133  The `tests/` directory contains HTML pages with component and pattern examples in order to facilitate development.  Please consult the official documentation (see below) for full details on how to use PatternFly.  The latest PatternFly test directory examples can be seen at [https://rawgit.com/patternfly/patternfly/master-dist/dist/tests/](https://rawgit.com/patternfly/patternfly/master-dist/dist/tests/).  \n134  \n135  If you are developing on PatternFly and would like to provide a link to a test directory from your fork, TravisCI can be configured to create a copy of your branch with the dist files generated for you.  No code changes are necessary to enable this, all that is needed is to login to [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) and configure it to point at your PatternFly fork.  The first three steps at their [Getting Started page](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners) provide instructions on how to do this.  You will also need to add an AUTH_TOKEN variable to Travis generated in your GitHub account to allow Travis to connect to your fork.  \n136  \n137  The HTML pages in `dist/tests` are generated using Jekyll.  Do *not* edit these files directly.  See `tests/pages` to change these files.\n138  \n139  ### Unit Testing\n140  Unit tests are written for [Karma test server] (https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html) with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)\n141  \n142  ```\n143  grunt karma\n144  ```\n145  ## Release\n146  \n147  PatternFly is released through the Bower and npm.\n148  \n149  To release a new version version of PatternFly, edit `bower.json` and `package.json` accordingly.\n150  \n151  Update the version listed in `bower.json` by editing the file and changing the line:\n152  \n153  ```\n154  \"version\": \"<new_version>\"\n155  ```\n156  \n157  Update the version listed in `package.json` by editing the file and changing the line:\n158  \n159  ```\n160  \"version\": \"<new_version>\"\n161  ```\n162  \n163  Commit the version bump:\n164  \n165  ```\n166  git commit -a -m \"Version bump to <new_version>\"\n167  ```\n168  \n169  Tag and push upstream (assuming you have commit access):\n170  \n171  ```\n172  git tag <new_version>\n173  git push && git push --tags\n174  ```\n175  \n176  The Bower package manager determines available versions and installs based upon git tags, so the new version will now be automatically available via Bower.\n177  \n178  To publish a new version to npm, execute:\n179  \n180  ```\n181  npm publish\n182  ```\n183  \n184  ## Documentation\n185  \n186  See [https://www.patternfly.org](https://www.patternfly.org) and [http://getbootstrap.com/](http://getbootstrap.com/).  \n187  \n188  ### Browser and Device Support\n189  \n190  Since PatternFly is based on Bootstrap, PatternFly supports [the same browsers as Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support) **excluding Internet Explorer 8**, plus the latest version of [Firefox for Linux](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-firefox-linux).\n191  \n192  *Important:*  starting with the v2.0.0 release, **PatternFly no longer supports Internet Explorer 8**.\n193  \n194  ### Product Backlog\n195  \n196  See [https://patternfly.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=PTNFLY&rapidView=4&view=planning](https://patternfly.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=PTNFLY&rapidView=4&view=planning).\n197  \n198  ### Bug List\n199  \n200  Official tracking of bugs occurs in Jira.  See https://patternfly.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=10300\n201  \n202  ## License\n203  \n204  Modifications to Bootstrap are copyright 2013 Red Hat, Inc. and licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).\n"

            ColVis adds a button to the toolbars around DataTables which gives the end user of the table the ability to dynamically change the visibility of the columns in the table:

            * Dynamically show and hide columns in a table
            * Very easy integration with DataTables

            ColVis adds a button to the toolbars around DataTables which gives the end user of the table the ability to dynamically change the visibility of the columns in the table:

            * Dynamically show and hide columns in a table
            * Very easy integration with DataTables
            * Ability to exclude columns from being either hidden or shown

          Stateful EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateful` annotation with a bean-defining annotation
           that encompasses the appropriate scope (e.g., `@ApplicationScoped`). `@Stateful` EJBs often translate to `@SessionScoped`
           beans (a scope which requires activating the `quarkus-undertow` extension), but the appropriate scope may differ based
           on your application architecture. Review your application's requirements to determine the appropriate scope.

           Note that it is recommended, as a good practice, to keep state external from the service in Quarkus.

        message: "Remote EJBs are not supported in Quarkus, and therefore its use must be removed and replaced with REST functionality. In order to do this:\n 1. Replace the `@Remote` annotation on the class with a `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path(\"<endpoint>\")` annotation. An endpoint must be added to the annotation in place of `<endpoint>` to specify the actual path to the REST service.\n 2. Remove `@Stateless` annotations if present. Given that REST services are stateless by nature, it makes it unnecessary.\n 3. For every public method on the EJB being converted, do the following:\n - In case the method has no input parameters, annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.GET`; otherwise annotate it with `@jakarta.ws.rs.POST` instead.\n - Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path(\"<endpoint>\")` and give it a proper endpoint path. As a rule of thumb, the method name can be used as endpoint, for instance:\n ```\n @Path(\"/increment\")\n public void increment() \n ```\n - Add `@jakarta.ws.rs.QueryParam(\"<param-name>\")` to any method parameters if needed, where `<param-name>` is a name for the parameter."
